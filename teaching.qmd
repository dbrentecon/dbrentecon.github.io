## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching emphasizes rigorous causal reasoning applied to real-world policy questions. Across graduate and undergraduate courses, I focus on helping students develop intuition for identification, connect theory to data, and implement modern empirical methods using reproducible workflows in R.

## Graduate Courses

### Causal Inference and Applied Econometrics (PhD)

**EEFE 530 — Penn State University**

This course provides doctoral students with a rigorous introduction to causal inference for applied research. Topics include potential outcomes, identification, randomized and quasi-experimental designs, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, panel methods, and threats to validity. The course emphasizes implementation in R and reproducible research using GitHub.

## Undergraduate Courses

### Personal Financial Decision-Making

An applied course covering budgeting, credit, student loans, investing, insurance, and retirement planning. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based decision-making and long-term financial wellbeing.

### Environmental Economics and Policy

Introduction to the economic analysis of environmental and natural resource issues, including externalities, public goods, climate change, and environmental regulation.

### Economic Analysis of Environmental and Resource Policies

Applied course focused on benefit–cost analysis, policy evaluation, and empirical evidence in environmental and resource economics.

## Teaching Materials

I make course materials publicly available when possible, including lecture slides, assignments, and replication code. Materials are typically hosted on GitHub to support transparency, version control, and reproducibility.

## Advising

I advise PhD and MS students on applied research in environmental economics, water resources, and causal inference. I am especially interested in projects that combine field experiments, administrative data, and policy evaluation.
