I am applied microeconomist with a focus on environmental economics and water resources. I am currently an associate professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics, Sociology, & Education (AESE) at The Pennsylvania State University. I use methods of causal inference such as field experiments, discrete choice experiments, and the econometric analysis of observational data.
