    "text": "Peer effects in voluntary environmental programs: An application to urban water quality (with Douglas Wrenn; Gabe Lara; Joe Cook - Accepted Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nStormwater runoff is a growing source of urban water pollution, costing cities billions of dollars. We investigate peer effects in a voluntary residential green stormwater infrastructure program that mitigates stormwater runoff. Our identification strategy exploits households’ relative position in eligible sewersheds that generates plausibly exogenous variation in eligible peers. Peer adoption causes a 0.2% increase in the annual adoption probability, a 66% increase relative to the mean. According to our calculations, the policy reduced compliance costs by $85–235 million for the Seattle metropolitan area, of which roughly 40% is due to peer effects.\n\nConservation and distributional consequences of pricing scarce water during droughts (with Derek Wietelman; Casey Wichman - Revise & Resubmit Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing price incentives to allocate scarce resources is a core tenet of economics but may result in unpalatable distributional outcomes. We analyze the efficacy of prices as a means of inducing water conservation during severe drought by studying the introduction of surcharges enacted within existing nonlinear rate structures. Embedding machine learning counterfactual prediction methods within a demand framework to isolate exogenous price variation, we find evidence that households exhibit a significant demand response despite the temporary nature of surcharges. However, further investigation reveals that surcharges alone cannot explain a majority of the conservation observed despite steep price increases. “Budget-based” rates undercut scarcity signals by shielding large users from binding price increases, and surcharges themselves do little to reduce the regressivity of water expenditures. Simpler rate structures can dominate along equity dimensions, and their progressivity can be enhanced via lump-sum transfers within the rate structure.\n\nDo behavioral nudges interact with prevailing economic incentives? Evidence from water consumption (with Casey Wichman)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nBehavioral nudges are popular instruments to promote prosocial behavior, particularly in settings with unpriced externalities. Nudges may interact with existing incentives, however, by crowding out intrinsic motivation to conserve or by increasing price salience. We investigate the interaction of prices and nudges for water conservation in two experiments in neighboring utilities. First, we layer randomized behavioral treatments on top of price variation driven by lot-size thresholds that exogenously assign marginal prices. Second, we explore whether behavioral treatments affect consumers’ price elasticities. Our findings suggest that nudges do not induce more conservation at higher prices, nor do they increase price sensitivity.\n\nConsumer value of information and the behavioral response to carbon and calorie food labels (with Amit Sharma; Dahlia Durun Barruah)\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe food system accounts for up to a third of global emissions, with carbon footprints varying greatly by food type. Despite this, carbon footprint labels are not required on restaurant menus, unlike calorie labels for large U.S. chains, and voluntary adoption is not common. This study examines consumer willingness to pay for carbon and calorie labels and their joint effect on food choices through a randomized field experiment (N=313) at a university restaurant. Participants received either a standard or augmented menu with calorie and carbon information, with one treatment arm randomizing the price for accessing this information. The augmented menu reduced beef consumption by 15%, primarily shifting choices to chicken. Among those actively choosing the information, beef consumption decreased by over 33%. Consumers valued the labels at 11% of the meal cost. These findings highlight demand for environmental transparency and its potential to shift consumer behavior toward lower-carbon food choices.\n\nAdopting solar power for irrigation: Implications for groundwater depletion in Gujarat (with Praharsh Patel; Emily Pakhtigian; Christopher Scott - email for a copy)\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nGroundwater is a vital resource for irrigation in India supporting food security and rural livelihoods. Energy subsidies for groundwater pumping improve short-term water access but worsen over-extraction incentives, accelerating depletion of this already overused common pool resource. Economic theory supports pricing or taxing groundwater, but even removing subsidies is politically difficult. Grid-connected solar irrigation offers a potential solution by creating an incentive to conserve groundwater from selling unused energy back to the grid. This study evaluates the impact of grid-connected solar irrigation under the Suryashakti Kisan Yojna (SKY) policy through a survey of 2,798 farmers.

    "text": "Peer effects in voluntary environmental programs: An application to urban water quality (with Douglas Wrenn; Gabe Lara; Joe Cook - Accepted Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nStormwater runoff is a growing source of urban water pollution, costing cities billions of dollars. We investigate peer effects in a voluntary residential green stormwater infrastructure program that mitigates stormwater runoff. Our identification strategy exploits households’ relative position in eligible sewersheds that generates plausibly exogenous variation in eligible peers. Peer adoption causes a 0.2% increase in the annual adoption probability, a 66% increase relative to the mean. According to our calculations, the policy reduced compliance costs by $85–235 million for the Seattle metropolitan area, of which roughly 40% is due to peer effects.\n\nConservation and distributional consequences of pricing scarce water during droughts (with Derek Wietelman; Casey Wichman - Revise & Resubmit Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing price incentives to allocate scarce resources is a core tenet of economics but may result in unpalatable distributional outcomes. We analyze the efficacy of prices as a means of inducing water conservation during severe drought by studying the introduction of surcharges enacted within existing nonlinear rate structures. Embedding machine learning counterfactual prediction methods within a demand framework to isolate exogenous price variation, we find evidence that households exhibit a significant demand response despite the temporary nature of surcharges. However, further investigation reveals that surcharges alone cannot explain a majority of the conservation observed despite steep price increases. “Budget-based” rates undercut scarcity signals by shielding large users from binding price increases, and surcharges themselves do little to reduce the regressivity of water expenditures. Simpler rate structures can dominate along equity dimensions, and their progressivity can be enhanced via lump-sum transfers within the rate structure.\n\nDo behavioral nudges interact with prevailing economic incentives? Evidence from water consumption (with Casey Wichman)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nBehavioral nudges are popular instruments to promote prosocial behavior, particularly in settings with unpriced externalities. Nudges may interact with existing incentives, however, by crowding out intrinsic motivation to conserve or by increasing price salience. We investigate the interaction of prices and nudges for water conservation in two experiments in neighboring utilities. First, we layer randomized behavioral treatments on top of price variation driven by lot-size thresholds that exogenously assign marginal prices. Second, we explore whether behavioral treatments affect consumers’ price elasticities. Our findings suggest that nudges do not induce more conservation at higher prices, nor do they increase price sensitivity.\n\nConsumer value of information and the behavioral response to carbon and calorie food labels (with Amit Sharma; Dahlia Durun Barruah)\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe food system accounts for up to a third of global emissions, with carbon footprints varying greatly by food type. Despite this, carbon footprint labels are not required on restaurant menus, unlike calorie labels for large U.S. chains, and voluntary adoption is not common. This study examines consumer willingness to pay for carbon and calorie labels and their joint effect on food choices through a randomized field experiment (N=313) at a university restaurant. Participants received either a standard or augmented menu with calorie and carbon information, with one treatment arm randomizing the price for accessing this information. The augmented menu reduced beef consumption by 15%, primarily shifting choices to chicken. Among those actively choosing the information, beef consumption decreased by over 33%. Consumers valued the labels at 11% of the meal cost. These findings highlight demand for environmental transparency and its potential to shift consumer behavior toward lower-carbon food choices.\n\nAdopting solar power for irrigation: Implications for groundwater depletion in Gujarat (with Praharsh Patel; Emily Pakhtigian; Christopher Scott - email for a copy)\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nGroundwater is a vital resource for irrigation in India supporting food security and rural livelihoods. Energy subsidies for groundwater pumping improve short-term water access but worsen over-extraction incentives, accelerating depletion of this already overused common pool resource. Economic theory supports pricing or taxing groundwater, but even removing subsidies is politically difficult. Grid-connected solar irrigation offers a potential solution by creating an incentive to conserve groundwater from selling unused energy back to the grid. This study evaluates the impact of grid-connected solar irrigation under the Suryashakti Kisan Yojna (SKY) policy through a survey of 2,798 farmers. Our findings indicate that major implementation challenges limit the ability of solar irrigation to incentivize groundwater conservation. These findings highlight the importance of policy implementation to meet policy objectives.\n\n\n\nFinancial literacy and academic outcomes (with Douglas Wrenn)\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nOutstanding student debt has almost doubled in the past decade to over $1.7 trillion.
